  <h1>Joscelyn</h1>
    
    <p>
      Joscelyn is an uncompromising secretary-hand font that provides the
      most realistic rendering available anywhere of this notoriously difficult
      Renaissance hand. Below is a sample, taken
      from Sir Philip Sidney's <i>Astrophel and Stella.</i> The box is
      editable: feel free to type your own text.
    </p>

  <p id="joscelyndemo" contenteditable="true" class="samplebox">Louing in trueth, and fayne in verse my loue to show,
That she, deare Shee, might take som pleasure of my paine,
Pleasure might cause her reade, reading might make her know,
Knowledge might pittie winne, and pity grace obtaine,
I sought fit wordes to paint the blackest face of woe.</p>

    <p>
      If you've installed Joscelyn on your system and noticed that
      it looks different when you type there from the way it looks
      here (where is that big loopy high s?), that is because
      Joscelyn depends on several OpenType features that are enabled
      by default in all major web browsers and most major software,
      <b>with the notable exception of Microsoft Word</b>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      To enable these features in Word, do either of two things. <b>1.</b> The
      easiest option is to start a document by double-clicking the Joscelyn.dotx
      template, and in the new document that opens, apply the
      “Joscelyn” character style to any stretch of text. <b>2.</b> Alternatively, open
      the “Font” dialog box, click over to the “Advanced” tab,
      and check the boxes to enable “Kerning,” “Standard Ligatures”
      and “Contextual Alternates.” That's all there is to it!
